            <ul>
                <li>Essential staff should take direction from their supervisors as to if they should be on campus.</li>
                <li>
                    All other employees not deemed essential are expected to continue to work remotely, where possible, and perform their assigned duties or be available to do so during normally scheduled work hours.

                <li>
                    All courses that can be instructed remotely have been transitioned to this form of instruction. However, there are some courses that will not be able to transition to remote instruction such as laboratory sessions. In those cases, we are working on a plan to lessen class size through alternative schedules in observance of social distancing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faculty members and students should be in correspondence as to what course work looks like throughout the remainder of the semester.
